    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Chicken Parmigiana (Pollo alla parmigiana in Italian) is also known in Australia as a Parm, Parma, or Parmi. Before chicken parmesan was eggplant parmesan, where eggplant slices are breaded and fried and layered with sauce and parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>
        <li>Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</li>
        <li>THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?</li>
        <li>Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.</li>
    </ol>
